Hi, guys. 

My name is Kexin Yan. My usc email address is kexinyan@usc.edu , which is something kind of obvious. 

I got a new IBM keyboard with red point. Therefore, I can put the laptop on the table higher so that my eyes can look directly at the screen. The new keyboard is very comfortable for using with only one annoying shortcoming. 

Fn is on the left of Ctrl! (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻
