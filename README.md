Things you have to do to invoke lab1.py:

1. download it from github and unzip it

2. open Jupyter and create new python3 notebook

3. load your code and run it(shift+enter)
     a. if lab1.py in the jupyter folder: %load lab1.py
     b. if they are in different folder: %load lab1-folder-path/lab1.py
     
4. invoke the function
