Hi, guys. 

My name is Kexin Yan. My usc email address is kexinyan@usc.edu . 

Things you have to do to invoke lab1.py:

a.define a function
   
    1.you have to define a function first, which should be like this.
    
        def has_to_be_a_function_to_be_invoked():
       
      def is keyword. 
      Then give the new function a name: has_to_be_a_function_to_be_invoked . 
      If the function doesn't need an arguments, the parentheses after the name is empty. Otherwise parameters should in the parentheses.
      Finally, there is always a colon after parentheses.
       
    2.Now, this function is empty, you should add code to do things. other language use big parentheses to identify codes in function. python use spaces. There should be at least 4 spaces before code on the next line, which should be like this.
       
        def has_to_be_a_function_to_be_invoked():
            print('Welcome to DCSCI510!')
           
b. invoke function

    Write the fuction name with parentheses. Don't add colon. And it should align with the define function line.
    
        def has_to_be_a_function_to_be_invoked():
            print('Welcome to DCSCI510!')
        has_to_be_a_function_to_be_invoked()

c. write notes 

    To tell others the use of this function
    
        # Welcome others to class
        def has_to_be_a_function_to_be_invoked():
            print('Welcome to DCSCI510!')
        has_to_be_a_function_to_be_invoked()
